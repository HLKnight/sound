# ---------- SOUND SENSOR PROJECT ----------

This project is meant to collect sound level at a proximity of a Raspberry Pi
(RPi) device. The RPi is equipped with a USB sound card (C-media Electronics,
Inc. Audio Adapter) and a microphone. The sound is recorded at 16000Hz sample
rate and every second will produce 80 pieces of RMS value as a bar-diagram.
